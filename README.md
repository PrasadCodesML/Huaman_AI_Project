AI-Powered Behavioral Analysis for Suicide Prevention, Substance Use, and Mental Health Crisis Detection with Longitudinal Geospatial Crisis Trend Analysis

**Description**
Public health agencies and crisis service providers face challenges in detecting and addressing emerging suicide, substance use, and mental health crises in real time. Traditional public health data sources—such as hospital admissions, overdose reports, and crisis hotline statistics—are valuable but lag behind the actual emergence of crises within communities. This project proposes an AI-driven public health monitoring system that integrates:

- Behavioral tracking – Analyzing how individuals engage with crisis-related content to identify patterns of distress escalation.
- Crisis-related language analysis – Detecting keywords, slang, and coded language used to discuss mental health struggles, suicidality, and substance use.
- Geospatial crisis mapping with longitudinal trend analysis – Identifying where distress-related discussions are concentrated and tracking changes over time to detect increasing crisis trends within specific geographic regions. By collecting and analyzing this data over time, this system will provide early-warning indicators of worsening mental health conditions and emerging substance use risks in communities. These insights can help service providers predict areas of growing crisis and proactively allocate resources to where they are needed most.
